## Vhalur PickEms
Welcome to my personal project for semester 3 of Software Engineering at Fontys ICT Eindhoven!

# Who am I
Hi!

# The Project
This project was inspired by my friends. Every year, Riot Games hosts the World Championship for League of Legends. With this, they add a web guessing game called 'PickEm'. Here you can guess who you think will win the next matches and the championship! Unfortunately, they don't have this mini-game during the regular seasons throughout the year, despite us wanting to continue this fun competition among ourselves. That's why I've decided to try and create a version of it for us!
