# Vhalur PickEms
Welcome to my semester 3 portfolio of Software Engineering at Fontys Eindhoven.

##About Me
My name is Casper van den Dijk, a student at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. Here I study the HBO ICT course, currently in the third semester of software engineering. 

For this semester I have been working on two projects: My individual project (IP) and the group project (GP).

##Individual Project
### The Concept
This project was inspired by my friends. Every year, Riot Games hosts the World Championship for League of Legends. With this, they add a web guessing game called 'PickEm'. Here you can guess who you think will win the next matches and the championship! Unfortunately, they don't have this mini-game during the regular seasons throughout the year, despite us wanting to continue this fun competition among ourselves. That's why I've decided to try and create a version of it for us! 

###Documentation
