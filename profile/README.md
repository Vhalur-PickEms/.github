# Welcome to Vhalur PickEms!

## About Me
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Casper van den Dijk, a student at Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven. Here I study the HBO ICT course, currently in the third semester of software engineering. 

For this semester I have been working on two projects: My individual project (IP) and the group project (GP).

## Individual Project
### The Concept
This project was inspired by my friends. Every year, Riot Games hosts the World Championship for League of Legends. With this, they add a web guessing game called 'PickEm'. Here you can guess who you think will win the next matches and the championship! Unfortunately, they don't have this mini-game during the regular seasons throughout the year, despite us wanting to continue this fun competition among ourselves. That's why I've decided to try and create a version of it for us!

### Learning outcomes
#### 1. Web application (IP)

>Clarification:
>
>User friendly: You apply best practices when creating user interfaces and basic user experience testing and development techniques.
>
>Full-stack: You design and build a full stack application using a commonly accepted front end Javascript framework and back end application implementing relevant >communication protocols, persistence of data by usage of ORM and addressing asynchronous communication issues.


#### 2. Software quality (IP)
>Clarification:
>
>Tooling and methodology: Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well >as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

#### 3. Agile method (GP)
>Clarification:
>
>Choose: You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on well-defined >selection criteria and context analyses.

#### 4. CI/CD (IP)
>Clarification:
>
>Design and implement: You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).


#### 5. Cultural differences and ethics (GP)
>Clarifications:
>
>Recognize: Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.
>
>Take into account: Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures;
>
>Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.  

#### 6. Requirements and design (GP)
>Clarification:
>
>Multiple types of test techniques: You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of >the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.

#### 7. Business process (GP)
>Clarification:
>
>Simple: Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.
>
>Related: Business processes during which the software that you are developing will be used (business processes that the software must support by fully or partially >automating them). 
>
>or
>
>Business processes needed for the success of your software development project (e.g., product release, market release, financial assurance).

#### 8. Proffessional (GP/IP)
>
>Clarification:
>
>Professional manner: 
>
>You develop software as a team effort according to a prescribed software methodology and following team agreements. You are able to track your work progress and >communicate your progress with the team.
>
>You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.
>You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.
